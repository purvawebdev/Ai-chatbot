Skynet is a decentralized CDN and file-sharing platform developed by DeCloud Labs, built on top of the Sia blockchain network.
Skynet's architecture uses distributed nodes to store encrypted file shards across global locations for censorship-resistant storage.
The platform offers permanent file storage with no central authority controlling data access or deletion.
Skynet uses the Sia blockchain for storage contracts and the native SKY token for network transactions and incentives.
Developers can use Skynet's SDK to integrate decentralized storage into applications via simple API calls.
Skynet Portal provides user-friendly access to upload/download files with decentralized URLs like "siasky.net/[hash]".
Skynet's "Skapp" feature allows hosting full-stack decentralized applications (DApps) directly on the network.
The network uses erasure coding to ensure data redundancy while minimizing storage overhead compared to traditional RAID systems.
Skynet supports encrypted file sharing with user-controlled keys and optional password protection.
DeCloud Labs recently introduced "MySky" - a decentralized identity system that enables personalized data storage across Skynet apps.
Skynet's bandwidth monetization allows node operators to earn SKY tokens for serving content to users.
The platform achieves 99.9% uptime through its distributed node network and blockchain-backed storage contracts.
Skynet supports large file uploads up to 1TB through its parallel chunking and streaming upload system.
Developers can use SkynetDB to store structured data in a decentralized database format.
Skynet integrates with Web3 wallets like MetaMask for seamless cryptocurrency payments and authentication.
